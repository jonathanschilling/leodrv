This is a basic skeleton of a Linux kernel driver for the Hermstedt(tm) Leonardo(tm) ISDN PCI cards.

Those cards feature a 68HC001 CPU and some RAM that I intended to use as a 68k development system.
A few more details on this endeavor can be found [on my personal website](https://jonathanschilling.github.io/labathome.de/elektrotechnik/leonardo_xl/).
